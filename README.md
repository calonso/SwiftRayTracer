SwiftRayTracer
==============

Swift Ray Tracer project from Swift Hands On Dojo Session

In this project you can see the raytraced representation of a circle and an overlapping triangle that are in the view behind.

The front view computes the color of each cell by raytracing from the middle of it to the backing view.
